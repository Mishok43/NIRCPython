## Abstract

We introduce an efficient **Two-Level Monte Carlo** (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the **Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC)** leveraging the power of tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly.

## Installation

This implementation is based on **Falcor 7.0**. Please follow the complete installation guide for Falcor and all its dependencies:

üìñ **[Falcor Installation Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor)**

### Additional Dependencies

This project requires the following additional dependencies beyond Falcor:

1. **tiny-cuda-nn**: Required for neural network training
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn
   cd tiny-cuda-nn/bindings/torch
   python setup.py install
   ```
   üìñ **[tiny-cuda-nn Installation Guide](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn)**

2. **Python Dependencies**: Install required Python packages
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib tqdm pyexr pyyaml
   ```

## Usage

### Running Experiments

The main experiment script reproduces results from **Figure 6** and **Section 6.1** of our paper:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts/ours

# Run the main experiment notebook
jupyter notebook ours.ipynb
```

### Available Scenes

Due to repository size limitations, only the **Cornell Box** scene is provided. The script can be adapted for other scenes by adding scene files to the appropriate data directory
